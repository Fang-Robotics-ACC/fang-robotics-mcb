Welcome to fang-mcb documentation!
==================================

Here you will find documentation for Fang Robotics MCB embedded and control 
code. Navigate to a specific subject by searching. Exlore various Browse through 
code by looking through "Library API" below. We recommend starting from the 
namespace section to navigate to that which is under the fang namespace. For 
your convenience, there is generated modm and taproot api documentation for the 
exact version associated with the RTD build!

There are sections and articles as well regarding how and why this code works 
such as Code Architecture. There will be tutorials on creating a new general 
subsystem, too.

TODO:
Add oddities to look out for (stack size, units.h linear and angular, multiple 
inheritance shenanigans), case studies before and after refactoring, custom 
stuff (FANG_ASSERT), etc.
