A docker container is a mini os usually with software installed to build a gievn piece of source code. 
You can yeet these tiny os's around the internet so people can compile it without having to do commands
or other computers, too, such as with Github Actions to auto-test proposed changes before they become cannon.

We use github actions which are triggered by an event such as a pull request. The github computers automatically
attempt to compile the code and run the tests, and then give us if it went well... or not ^_^

You'll have to update the .github/workflow/build-test.yaml for the new name!

To make
```
make
```

To tag
```
./ghcr-tag.sh v5.0.0
```
Tagging scheme
{release version made}-v{container number}
So when we move to v5.0.1
we will still use v5.0.0-v2
But then the next versions will be 
v5.0.1-v1
v5.0.1-v2
v5.0.1-v3
and so on

To upload (log into docker.ghcr.io)
```
docker push g # press tab for autocomplete
docker push ghcr.io/fang-robotics-acc/fang-robotics-mcb:VERSION
docker push ghcr.io/fang-robotics-acc/fang-robotics-mcb:v5.0.0-v2
```
